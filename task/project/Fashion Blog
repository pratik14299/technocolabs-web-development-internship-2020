            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_Blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly
            fun
            & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide
            and
            make your first show a pleasurable experience. <br> By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut,
            you’ll have
            an unforgettable experience!

    <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows :</h2>

            If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected
            my
            first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. <br> First, plan out which shows are most important to you and
            make a
            schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. <br> If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time
            you
            won’t
            have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. <br>
            Lastly,
            purchase your tickets and get excited!

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows:</h2>

        <p>
            Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will
            show. <br>
            Remember, <em>NYFW </em> is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
            express through
            their new lines. <br> Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day.Obviously you want
            to
            look
            good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
